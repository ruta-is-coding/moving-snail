# A moving snail

I made a moving snail image, which uses DOM keyboard events, by working with my groupmates and following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg1UqzZ5NQM&ab_channel=DollarDesignSchool) from Dollar Design School. The object rotates in the direction of movement and is prevented from moving off the screen. Click any keyboard arrow to move the snail
